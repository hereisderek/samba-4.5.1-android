.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\ 'u
smbcontrol [\-s] [\-t|\-\-timeout]
.HP \w'\ 'u
smbcontrol [destination] [message\-type] [parameter]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the
\fBsamba\fR(7)
suite\&.
.PP
smbcontrol
is a very small program, which sends messages to a
\fBsmbd\fR(8), a
\fBnmbd\fR(8), or a
\fBwinbindd\fR(8)
daemon running on the system\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-t|\-\-timeout
.RS 4
Set timeout to seconds\&.
.RE
.PP
destination
.RS 4
One of
\fInmbd\fR,
\fIsmbd\fR,
\fIwinbindd\fR
or a process ID\&.
.sp
The
\fIall\fR
destination causes the message to "broadcast" to all running daemons including nmbd and winbind\&. This is a change for Samba 3\&.3, prior to this the parameter smbd used to do this\&.
.sp
The
\fIsmbd\fR
destination causes the message to be sent to the smbd daemon specified in the
smbd\&.pid
file\&.
.sp
The
\fInmbd\fR
destination causes the message to be sent to the nmbd daemon specified in the
nmbd\&.pid
file\&.
.sp
The
\fIwinbindd\fR
destination causes the message to be sent to the winbind daemon specified in the
winbindd\&.pid
file\&.
.sp
If a single process ID is given, the message is sent to only that process\&.
.RE
.PP
message\-type
.RS 4
Type of message to send\&. See the section
\fBMESSAGE\-TYPES\fR
for details\&.
.RE
.PP
parameters
.RS 4
any parameters required for the message\-type
.RE
.SH "MESSAGE-TYPES"
.PP
Available message types are:
.PP
close\-share
.RS 4
Order smbd to close the client connections to the named share\&. Note that this doesn\*(Aqt affect client connections to any other shares\&. This message\-type takes an argument of the share name for which client connections will be closed, or the "*" character which will close all currently open shares\&. This may be useful if you made changes to the access controls on the share\&. This message can only be sent to
\fBsmbd\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
debug
.RS 4
Set debug level to the value specified by the parameter\&. This can be sent to any of the destinations\&. If this message is sent to either the smbd or winbindd daemons, the parent process will rebroadcast the message to all child processes changing the debug level in each one\&.
.RE
.PP
kill\-client\-ip
.RS 4
Order smbd to close the client connections from a given IP address\&. This message\-type takes an argument of the IP address from which client connections will be closed\&. This message can only be sent to
\fBsmbd\fR\&.
.RE

.RS 4
This message causes the
nmbd
daemon to force a new browse master election\&.
.RE

Request debuglevel of a certain daemon and write it to stdout\&. This can be sent to any of the destinations\&.
.RE
.PP
profilelevel
.RS 4

.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell\&. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed\&.
.PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer\&. The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp\&.icce\&.rug\&.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba 2\&.0 release by Jeremy Allison\&. The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2\&.2 was done by Gerald Carter\&. The conversion to DocBook XML 4\&.2 for Samba 3\&.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy\&.
