The Samba-Team are committed to an aggressive program to deliver quality
controlled software to a well defined roadmap.

Please also look at the Release planning pages of wiki.samba.org for more

The following development objectives for future releases
are in progress:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Samba-4.0.x		This release turned into security maintenance mode
			since we released 4.2.

Samba-4.1.x		Our previous release including the AD domain
			controller feature, the file server and other
			functionality from Samba 4.0.

Samba-4.2.x		Our current release.


Note that it is a given that the Samba-Team will continue to track
Windows releases, ensuring that Samba will work
well with whatever releases Redmond throws our way :-).
